# Temperature Logic Debug

Let's analyze a specific case:

## Configuration:
- max_comfort_temp_val = 27°C
- outdoor_temp = 30°C (example)
- comfort_category = "II" (±3°C)
- indoor_temp = 29°C (too hot)

## Calculations:
1. adaptive_comfort_temp = 18.9 + 0.255 × 30 = 26.55°C ≈ 26.6°C
2. comfort_tolerance = 3.0°C
3. comfort_temp_max = min(26.6 + 3.0, 27.0) = min(29.6, 27.0) = 27.0°C ✅

## Problem Identified:
In the original target_temp logic, when indoor_temp > comfort_temp_max:
- Occupied mode: comfort_temp_max = 27°C ✅
- Unoccupied mode: comfort_temp_max + setback = 27 + 2 = 29°C ❌

The problem was that when the environment was unoccupied and too hot, 
the automation was INCREASING the temperature instead of maintaining the maximum limit.

## Implemented Fix:
The new logic for unoccupied mode:
- If indoor_temp > comfort_temp_max: use comfort_temp_max (never exceed the limit)
- If indoor_temp < comfort_temp_min: use comfort_temp_min - setback (with minimum limit)
- Otherwise: use adaptive_comfort_temp

Now it will NEVER exceed the comfort limits configured by the user!
